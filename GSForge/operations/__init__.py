GSForge operations can be broken down into three categories:

Analytics
  For discrete operations, *i.e.* chi-squared tests, differential gene expression, etc.

Normalizations
  For those operations that are meant to create an entire transform of the GEM.

Prospectors
  For non-deterministic operations, used in ranking and comparing gene selections.
