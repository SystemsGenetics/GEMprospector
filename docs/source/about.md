# About GSForge

*GSForge* helps manage and compare gene (feature) selection methods for RNA-Seq data.
It provides a framework of tools that assist in the collection, management and comparison of feature selection results.

## Why use GSForge?

You should consider using `GSForge` when:

+ You have more than one feature selection method to use.
+ You have more than one normalization to explore.
+ You have more than one set of annotation or label files.
+ You have a feature selection method that is non-deterministic.

And you should seriously consider using `GSForge` if you find yourself in more than one of the above categories.
